    "This chapter introduces the application we will develop during the rest\n",
    "of the book, a web search engine. I describe the elements of a search\n",
    "engine and introduce the first application, a Web crawler that downloads\n",

    "implementation of depth-first search and an iterative implementation\n",
    "that uses a Java `Deque` to implement a \"last in, first out\" stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search engines\n",
    "\n",
    "A **web search engine**, like Google Search or Bing, takes a set of\n",
    "\"search terms\" and returns a list of web pages that are relevant to\n",
    "those terms (I'll discuss what \"relevant\" means later). You can read\n",
    "more at <http://thinkdast.com/searcheng>, but I'll explain what you need\n",
    "as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential components of a search engine are:\n",

    "    up a search term and find the pages that contain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Retrieval: And we'll need a way to collect results from the Index\n",
    "    and identify pages that are most relevant to the search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with the crawler. The goal of a crawler is to discover and\n",
    "download a set of web pages. For search engines like Google and Bing,\n",
    "the goal is to find *all* web pages, but often crawlers are limited to a\n",
    "smaller domain. In our case, we will only read pages from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we'll build a crawler that reads a Wikipedia page,\n",
    "finds the first link, follows the link to another page, and repeats. We\n",
    "will use this crawler to test the \"Getting to Philosophy\" conjecture,\n",
    "which states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Clicking on the first lowercase link in the main text of a Wikipedia\n",
    "> article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles,\n",
    "> usually eventually gets one to the Philosophy article.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conjecture is stated at <http://thinkdast.com/getphil>, and you can\n",
    "read its history there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the conjecture will allow us to build the basic pieces of a\n",
    "crawler without having to crawl the entire web, or even all of\n",
    "Wikipedia. And I think the exercise is kind of fun!\n",

    "## Stacks in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I explain the iterative version of DFS, I'll explain the stack\n",
    "data structure. We'll start with the general concept of a stack, which\n",
    "I'll call a \"stack\" with a lowercase \"s\". Then we'll talk about two Java\n",
    "`interfaces` that define stack methods: `Stack` and `Deque`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is a data structure that is similar to a list: it is a\n",
    "collection that maintains the order of the elements. The primary\n",
    "difference between a stack and a list is that the stack provides fewer\n",
    "methods. In the usual convention, it provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `push`: which adds an element to the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `pop`: which removes and returns the top-most element from the\n",
    "    stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `peek`: which returns the top-most element without modifying the\n",
    "    stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `isEmpty`: which indicates whether the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `pop` always returns the top-most element, a stack is also\n",
    "called a \"LIFO\", which stands for \"last in, first out\". An alternative\n",
    "to a stack is a \"queue\", which returns elements in the same order they\n",
    "are added; that is, \"first in, first out\", or FIFO.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might not be obvious why stacks and queues are useful: they don't\n",
    "provide any capabilities that aren't provided by lists; in fact, they\n",
    "provide fewer capabilities. So why not use lists for everything? There\n",
    "are two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you limit yourself to a small set of methods --- that is, a small\n",
    "    API --- your code will be more readable and less error-prone. For\n",
    "    example, if you use a list to represent a stack, you might\n",
    "    accidentally remove an element in the wrong order. With the stack\n",
    "    API, this kind of mistake is literally impossible. And the best way\n",
    "    to avoid errors is to make them impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If a data structure provides a small API, it is easier to implement\n",
    "    efficiently. For example, a simple way to implement a stack is a\n",
    "    singly-linked list. When we push an element onto the stack, we add\n",
    "    it to the beginning of the list; when we pop an element, we remove\n",
    "    it from the beginning. For a linked list, adding and removing from\n",
    "    the beginning are constant time operations, so this implementation\n",
    "    is efficient. Conversely, big APIs are harder to implement\n",
    "    efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a stack in Java, you have three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Go ahead and use `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`. If you use\n",
    "    `ArrayList`, be sure to add and remove from the *end*, which is a\n",
    "    constant time operation. And be careful not to add elements in the\n",
    "    wrong place or remove them in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Java provides a class called `Stack` that provides the standard set\n",
    "    of stack methods. But this class is an old part of Java: it is not\n",
    "    consistent with the Java Collections Framework, which came later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Probably the best choice is to use one of the implementations of the\n",
    "    `Deque` interface, like `ArrayDeque`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Deque\" stands for \"double-ended queue\"; it's supposed to be pronounced\n",
    "\"deck\", but some people say \"deek\". In Java, the `Deque` interface\n",
    "provides `push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `isEmpty`, so you can use a `Deque`\n",
    "as a stack. It provides other methods, which you can read about at\n",
