    "This example demonstrates two patterns you'll need for your solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For many methods, we have to handle the first element of the list as\n",
    "    a special case. In this example, if we are adding the first element\n",
    "    of a list, we have to modify `head`. Otherwise, we traverse the\n",
    "    list, find the end, and add the new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  This method shows how to use a `for` loop to traverse the nodes in a\n",
    "    list. In your solutions, you will probably write several variations\n",
    "    on this loop. Notice that we have to declare `node` before the loop\n",
    "    so we can access it after the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's your turn. Fill in the body of `indexOf`. As usual, you should\n",
    "read the documentation, at <http://thinkdast.com/listindof>, so you know\n",
    "what it is supposed to do. In particular, notice how it's supposed to\n",
    "handle `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous exercise, I provide a helper method called `equals`\n",
    "that compares an element from the array to a target value and checks\n",
    "whether they are equal --- and it handles `null` correctly. This method\n",
    "is private because it is used inside this class but it is not part of\n",
    "the `List` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done, run the tests again; `testIndexOf` should pass now,\n",
    "as well as the other tests that depend on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you should fill in the two-parameter version of `add`, which takes\n",
    "an index and stores the new value at the given index. Again, read the\n",
    "documentation at <http://thinkdast.com/listadd>, write an\n",
    "implementation, and run the tests for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last one: fill in the body of `remove`. The documentation is here:\n",
    "<http://thinkdast.com/listrem>. When you finish this one, all tests\n",
    "should pass.\n",
