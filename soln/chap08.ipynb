    "# Indexer\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have built a basic Web crawler; the next piece we will\n",
    "work on is the **index**. In the context of web search, an index is a\n",
    "data structure that makes it possible to look up a search term and find\n",
    "the pages where that term appears. In addition, we would like to know\n",
    "how many times the search term appears on each page, which will help\n",
    "identify the pages most relevant to the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user submits the search terms \"Java\" and\n",
    "\"programming\", we would look up both search terms and get two sets of\n",
    "pages. Pages with the word \"Java\" would include pages about the island\n",
    "of Java, the nickname for coffee, and the programming language. Pages\n",
    "with the word \"programming\" would include pages about different\n",
    "programming languages, as well as other uses of the word. By selecting\n",
    "pages with both terms, we hope to eliminate irrelevant pages and find\n",
    "the ones about Java programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what the index is and what operations it\n",
    "performs, we can design a data structure to represent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data structure selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental operation of the index is a **lookup**; specifically, we\n",
    "need the ability to look up a term and find all pages that contain it.\n",
    "The simplest implementation would be a collection of pages. Given a\n",
    "search term, we could iterate through the contents of the pages and\n",
    "select the ones that contain the search term. But the runtime would be\n",
    "proportional to the total number of words on all the pages, which would\n",
    "be way too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better alternative is a **map**, which is a data structure that\n",
    "represents a collection of **key-value pairs** and provides a fast way\n",
    "to look up a **key** and find the corresponding **value**. For example,\n",
    "the first map we'll construct is a `TermCounter`, which maps from each\n",
    "search term to the number of times it appears in a page. The keys are\n",
    "the search terms and the values are the counts (also called\n",
    "\"frequencies\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Java provides an interface called `Map` that specifies the methods a map\n",
    "should provide; the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `get(key)`: This method looks up a key and returns the corresponding\n",
    "    value.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `put(key, value)`: This method adds a new key-value pair to the\n",
    "    `Map`, or if the key is already in the map, it replaces the value\n",
    "    associated with `key`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java provides several implementations of `Map`, including the two we\n",
    "will focus on, `HashMap` and `TreeMap`. In upcoming chapters, we'll look\n",
    "at these implementations and analyze their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `TermCounter`, which maps from search terms to\n",
    "counts, we will define a class called `Index`, which maps from a search\n",
    "term to a collection of pages where it appears. And that raises the next\n",
    "question, which is how to represent a collection of pages. Again, if we\n",
    "think about the operations we want to perform, that guides our decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll need to combine two or more collections and find the\n",
    "pages that appear in all of them. You might recognize this operation as\n",
    "**set intersection**: the intersection of two sets is the set of\n",
    "elements that appear in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might expect by now, Java provides a `Set` interface that defines\n",
    "the operations a set should perform. It doesn't actually provide set\n",
    "intersection, but it provides methods that make it possible to implement\n",
    "intersection and other set operations efficiently. The core `Set`\n",
    "methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `add(element)`: This method adds an element to a set; if the element\n",
    "    is already in the set, it has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `contains(element)`: This method checks whether the given element is\n",
    "    in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java provides several implementations of `Set`, including `HashSet` and\n",
    "`TreeSet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've designed our data structures from the top down, we'll\n",
    "implement them from the inside out, starting with `TermCounter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TermCounter\n",
    "\n",
